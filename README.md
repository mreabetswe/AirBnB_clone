#Description
This is the first part of the project were we are required to create a prototype of a web application, integrating database storage, a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

The command intepreter is written in the console.py file. It is required to perform the following steps that make it efficient to manage the objects of the project:

> Create a new object (ex: a new User or * a new Place)
> Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
> Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
> Update attributes of an object
> Destroy an object

#Usage

Interactive mode example 

Run the console: ./console.py
Quit the console: (hbnb) quit
Display the help for a command: (hbnb) help <command>
Create an object (console prints the ID): (hbnb) create <class>
Typing help followed by a command returns a useful text that describes the command, for example: 
(hnbn) help create
Create command to create new instance

(hnbn)

Non-interactive mode example

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update
